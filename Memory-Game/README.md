## üìù What I did
* Worked collaboratively in a group to create a Memory Matching Game using JavaScript.  
* Helped organize the project plan and contributed heavily to the main functionality.  
* Developed the sleep function, cursor-control functions, and key parts of the matching and game logic.  
* Assisted with creating variables, assigning image sources, and refining game flow.

## üìä Results
* Created a fully functional memory game that tracks misses, flips cards, and ends correctly when all pairs are found.  
* Implemented asynchronous behavior for smoother interactions and better user experience.  
* Gained experience in collaboration and debugging while taking a lead role in the project‚Äôs logic and structure.
