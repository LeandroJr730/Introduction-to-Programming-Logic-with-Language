## 📂 About this Repository

This repository contains some of my main JavaScript and HTML projects created during the CIS-125 Introduction to Programming Logic course at Southeastern Community College (SCC).  
Even though I had prior knowledge of programming from self-study, this class helped strengthen my logical thinking, debugging, and structured coding practices through interactive assignments and small games.

## 🧠 Course Concepts

* Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, classes)
* Object-Oriented Programming basics
* DOM manipulation and user input with JavaScript
* Algorithmic problem solving
* HTML structure and interaction with JS
