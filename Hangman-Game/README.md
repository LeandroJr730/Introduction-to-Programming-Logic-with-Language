## 📝 What I did
* Designed a word-guessing Hangman game with JavaScript.
* Randomly selected a secret word from a predefined list.
* Replaced hidden letters with “*” and updated as the user guessed.
* Counted wrong guesses and ended the game after six failed attempts.

## 📊 Results
* Implemented string replacement using regular expressions.
* Used loops and conditionals to track and display game progress.
* Applied logical thinking and input validation for interactive gameplay.
