## 📝 What I did
* Built an interactive dice-rolling simulator using JavaScript.
* Allowed the user to choose how many dice to roll (1–10).
* Displayed each roll’s result on the screen and in the console.
* Added validation for incorrect inputs and a replay option.

## 📊 Results
* Simulated realistic random dice rolls using Math.random().
* Practiced using loops, conditionals, and event handling.
* Strengthened understanding of user input and DOM interaction.
